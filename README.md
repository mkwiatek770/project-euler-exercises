Benefits of working with Project Euler exercises:
* They’ll expose whether you understand the basic operations of the language you’re using, and they can be solved in any programming language
* You’ll learn how to write solid, standard, vanilla code. No libraries needed, so you won’t have crutches to rely on
* You’ll have to think about how you store and access data in memory
* You’ll need to optimize processing speed and think hard about algorithms
* Practise TDD
